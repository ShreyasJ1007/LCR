# License Plate Recognition System

## Description
The License Plate Recognition System is an application that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically detect and recognize license plates from images or video streams. It provides an efficient and accurate solution for automated license plate reading and data extraction.


## Features
- License Plate Detection: The system employs advanced algorithms to detect license plates within images.
- Character Segmentation: It performs character segmentation on the detected license plates to isolate individual characters.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Utilizing machine learning models, the system recognizes and extracts the alphanumeric characters from license plates.


## Technologies Used
- Python for the backend code.
- OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- pytesseract for training and deploying the OCR models.
